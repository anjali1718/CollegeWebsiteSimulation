            The statement that nurses form the backbone of the health workforce in India is better illustrated by the fact that nurses form over 60% of the health workforce in India. Although that might seem like a lot, the patient-to-nurse ratio in India is nowhere near the WHO- specified standard and India is still facing a shortage of nurses. According to a 2016 report, India needed over 24 lakh nurses to overcome the shortage and the demand has only grown with the years.
        </div><br>
        <div class="a">
            In such a job market that is facing an acute shortage and expecting an increase in demand, taking up nursing as a career after 12th is a great option for any student.
